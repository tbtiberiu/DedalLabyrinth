# Dedal's Labyrinth

![Home Page](home.png)

**Dedal's Labyrinth** is a project I developed during a 24-hour Hackathon organized by the University Politehnica of Bucharest and the Serviciul de Informa≈£ii Externe (SIE). The challenge was to create an application that could generate, visualize, and store labyrinth paths in a database. The solution was built using **React with TypeScript** for the front-end, and **ASP.NET Core 8** with a **MySQL** database for the back-end.

This was my first experience participating in a hackathon, competing as an independent developer against three teams of up to four members. Despite the challenge, I successfully achieved the task and was awarded **second place** in the competition.

### Features of Dedal's Labyrinth:

- **Path Generator**: Generate random labyrinths with visual representations.
- **Shortest Path Finder**: Calculate and display the shortest path within the generated labyrinth.
- **Database Integration**: Store and retrieve labyrinths from the database.

### Requirements:

To run this project, you need:

- **Node.js**: For running the React front-end.
- **Visual Studio**: For handling the ASP.NET Core back-end.
- **MySQL**: For the database to store labyrinth data.

### How to Use:

1. Open `DedalLabyrinth.sln` in **Visual Studio**.
2. Run the project by selecting **Start** or pressing **Ctrl + F5**.
3. The server will open with **Swagger UI** at [https://localhost:7031/swagger/index.html](https://localhost:7031/swagger/index.html).
4. The React app will be available at [https://localhost:5173](https://localhost:5173).

This setup will enable you to explore and test the project, interact with the server API via Swagger, and view the labyrinth paths generated on the front-end interface.
